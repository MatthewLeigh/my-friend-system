# My Friend System
My Friend System is a social media system developed as a university assignment. The system is developed with the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Advanced CSS techniques were utilized within the system to create a dynamic and appealing interface which offers modern interactions without utilizing JavaScript (as JS was prohibited as part of this assignment.)
